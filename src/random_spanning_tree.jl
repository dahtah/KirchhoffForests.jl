    random_spanning_tree(g, [r])

Generate a (uniform) random spanning tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree) using Wilson's algorithm (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/237814.237880).
A spanning tree of connected graph g is a connected subgraph of g that's cycle-free, i.e. a tree that includes only edges from g and connects every node.
If you specify the root of the tree, the function produces a spanning tree that is picked uniformly among all trees rooted at r.
If you do not specify a root, the function produces a random tree from g, picking *uniformly* among all spanning trees of g (over all possible roots).

NB: a graph must be connected in order to have a spanning tree. By default, the function checks that g is connected (in order to avoid an infinite loop). If you are positive g is connected, use force=true.

### Arguments
- g: a graph
- optional: r, index of a node to serve as root
- force: if true, skip connectivity test

### Output
If the root is specified, returns a tree, represented as a SimpleDiGraph. If it isn't, returns a named tuple with "tree": the tree and "root": the root.


### Examples

```@example
julia> g = cycle_graph(4)
{4, 4} undirected simple Int64 graph

julia> random_spanning_tree(g).tree |> edges |> collect
3-element Array{Graphs.SimpleGraphs.SimpleEdge{Int64},1}:
 Edge 2 => 3
 Edge 3 => 4
 Edge 4 => 1
```
TODO: Maybe consider the function random_spanning_tree as a meta function with a switch wilson / aldous..
